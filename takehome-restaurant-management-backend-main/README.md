# Ayora Frontend Take Home Challenge

## Introduction

Congratulations on progressing to our technical assessment! ðŸ’ª Thank you very much in advance for your time in completing this exercise. This will help us better understand how you think about frontend application development challenges.

This exercise is specifically for *frontend* developers, so *no backend work is expected*. You should assume the backend provided works 'as is'. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.

## The Challenge

You're building a dashboard for a company that owns several restaurants. To avoid the fees from existing delivery apps, they've built their own app for customers to place orders.

Lately there have been some issues; some restaurants are getting poor customer reviews. The Chief Financial Officer (CFO) would like to understand what's going on and see order statuses in realtime.

The platform team has built a backend service that provides a live feed of orders, as well as basic restaurant information. You've been given access to the backend repo with instructions on how to run it and access API docs.

Please build an app that the CFO can use to overview their current situation and hopefully learn more about the cause of poor reviews.

**The CFO needs a view of restaurants, with insights into how restaurants have been handling orders based on the data available**

## Specifications

- Please use **React** and **TypeScript** to build a web application
- Other frameworks, libraries and styling is left to you
- Please use the provided backend service to fetch data
- Please also include a README with clear instructions on how to run your project from a fresh setup, and discussion points on your solution, as well as any discussion you'd bring to a meeting with the backend developer on how to improve the service.
- Please create a private GitHub repo with your code and add @gordonmckenzie and @k2db.

## Endpoints

- ``http`` - ``GET /restaurants`` Get the IDs, names, and current user ratings (/5) of all restaurants
- ``websocket`` - ``/ws`` Stream of all past events and live streaming of new order events

## Models

Models can be found in the [types](src/types.ts) file.
The ``/restaurants`` HTTP endpoint returns a list of ``Restaurant``.
The websocket endpoint sends a stream of ``OrderEvent``.

## Using the backend

The backend is a simple Node.js application that uses Websockets. You will need to have `node.js` and `npm` installed.

### Install the packages

```bash
npm install
```

### Start the server

```bash
npm start
```
